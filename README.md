### Support

Support is available 7 days a week to verified customers who have purchased the script through the Tebex store linked above. Leaked or stolen copies of resources from 3rd party sites are not eligible for support. Please ensure you have the customer role in Discord first (this should be automatically done by Tebex), otherwise you will be asked for your Tebex order number. You must remain a member of the Discord to qualify for lifetime free support.

### Terms of Purchase

You automatically accept the following terms when you purchase a script from JG Scripts - whether licensed through FiveM Keymaster software or provided unlocked. JG Scripts retains the copyright for all content sold through our store.

You may not:

* Reverse engineer, or decompile the script in any way;
* Share the script with others or upload to public websites;
* Resell or redistribute the script

Violating these terms will result in your license to the product being removed (if applicable) and could result in your CFX account being reported or banned.

### Refunds

Refunds will be provided under certain circumstances. If you have an issue with a script, we are here to help! Open a ticket through create-a-ticket and a member of the team will try to help you as soon as possible.

A refund will be provided if the following is true:

* The script does not work for you, and a solution cannot be found;
* You purchased the script within the last 7 days
