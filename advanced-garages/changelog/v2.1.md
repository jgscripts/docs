## Files Changed & Configuration

{% hint style="info" %}
For the smoothest migration, re-configure your script from scratch in the [Configurator](https://configurator.jgscripts.com/advanced-garages).
{% endhint %}

All files have been changed and some new ones added. Please re-install the script, then import your existing config.lua to the [https://configurator.jgscripts.com/advanced-garages](https://configurator.jgscripts.com/advanced-garages)&#x20;

Make sure you triple check your configuration in the Configurator and make any necessary changes. Some new options have been added and other options removed. Most notably, blips are now applied on a per-garage basis, so make sure these are filled in!
