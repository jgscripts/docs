# v2.2.3

## Fixes

* Improves upon type checking from v2.2.2 - you should no longer have issues with addons, or need to update meta files in cases of vehicles incorrectly spawning!

### Game build concerns, you're OK!

* To give a sigh of relief for people using older game builds - I was wrong about it, my bad. Game builds such as 2699, are **completely fine!** - you only need server build 7290+. Your game build doesn't matter, as long as it's reasonably modern.

#### Changed Files

* client/cl-main.lua
