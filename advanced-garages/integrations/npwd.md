JG Advanced Garages app: [https://github.com/JG-Scripts/npwd\_jg\_advancedgarages](https://github.com/JG-Scripts/npwd\_jg\_advancedgarages)

We have built a custom app for npwd, that integrates seamlessly with JG Advanced Garages.

2. Unzip and add the resource to your server resources folder
3. Ensure `npwd_jg_advancedgarages` **before** `npwd`
4. Add app to NPWD `config.json` in the `apps` section `"apps": ["npwd_jg_advancedgarages"]`
