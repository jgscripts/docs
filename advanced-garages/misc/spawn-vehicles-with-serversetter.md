# Spawn Vehicles with ServerSetter

{% hint style="danger" %}
If you don't know what this means or don't care, don't touch this option at all. Leave it off.
{% endhint %}

If you know what this means, **I do recommend enabling it** but be aware you may experience reliability issues on more populated servers.

Having significant issues after enabling this? I beg you to just turn it off before opening a ticket with us.

HIGHLY recommended that you set `Config.DoNotSpawnInsideVehicle = false` if you decide to enable this.

Want to read my 'technical' rant about why server-sided vehicles are so frustrating in FiveM, or why this option even exists? See my blog:
