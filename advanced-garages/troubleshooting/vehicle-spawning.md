# Vehicle Spawning

### Can't index nil value`CreateVehicleServerSetter`&#x20;

Upgrade to **server build 7290** or newer (you should do this anyway for an important security update) - [https://runtime.fivem.net/artifacts/fivem/build\_server\_windows/master/](https://runtime.fivem.net/artifacts/fivem/build\_server\_windows/master/)&#x20;

### I can't upgrade or you can't use OneSync Infinity

In config.lua, set `Config.DisableServerVehicleSpawning = true`
