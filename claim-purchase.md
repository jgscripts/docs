### ⚠️ Check your server artifacts

Double check you are not using a broken, out of date or incompatible artifact by going to [our helpful database](https://artifacts.jgscripts.com/). At an absolute minimum, our scripts require 7290, but we suggest using the recommend artifact listed in the JG Scripts Artifact DB

### ⬇️ Downloading your script

To download your purchased asset, head over to Cfx.re Portal, linked below. Log in, then head to the "Assets" tab, and then "Granted Assets". If you have a lot of assets, you can search for `jg-`, which is the prefix used for all of our assets. Please note: after purchase, it may take up to 5 minutes to appear in your portal account.&#x20;

{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### 📂 Extracting the zip

Extract/open the zip file you just downloaded - it should end in `.pack.zip`. It should contain a folder ending in `-bundle`, such as `jg-advancedgarages-bundle`. Do **NOT** drag this folder into your server directly - open it up first. The folders inside are the resources that you can add to your server's resources folder.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### 🔄️ Restart your server

Fully restart your FiveM server. If you just start the script via the console or txAdmin while the server is running, you will likely run into a Keymaster escrow error. Restarting your server will ensure your server is aware of your new license.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### ☑️ Done!

Now that the script files are successfully on your server, see the installation instructions for your particular script in the sidebar. You'll finds loads of other useful info in these docs too, such as exports, guides and common errors that you may run into. Have fun!
