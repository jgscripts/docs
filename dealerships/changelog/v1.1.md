## Upgrade Instructions

1. Replace **all** files
2. Run the following SQL code in your database (works for both QB & ESX):

```sql
ALTER TABLE `dealership_data` ADD IF NOT EXISTS `employee_commission` INT NOT NULL DEFAULT '10';

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `dealership_employees` (
  `id` int(11) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  `identifier` varchar(255) NOT NULL,
  `dealership` varchar(255) NOT NULL,
  `role` varchar(100) NOT NULL,
  `joined` datetime NOT NULL DEFAULT current_timestamp(),
  PRIMARY KEY (`id`),
  KEY `fk_employees_dealership` (`dealership`),
  CONSTRAINT `fk_employees_dealership` FOREIGN KEY (`dealership`) REFERENCES `dealership_data` (`name`)
);
```

## New Chat Command

All dealership employees (any rank) get access to the new `/directsale` chat command. This brings up a menu and shows a tablet emote in-game, allowing the employee to sell a vehicle directly to a nearby player. The nearby player will have to approve and sign to finalise the purchase.

This will only work if they are (1) employed by that dealership (2) close enough to the "showroom" coords location. The radius can be configured via `directSaleDistance` within the dealership location within `config.lua`

## Config File Changes

You should probably use the Configurator: [https://configurator.jgscripts.com](https://configurator.jgscripts.com)

<pre class="language-lua"><code class="lang-lua">Config.PlateFormat = "1AA111AA" -- 1 = number, A = letter (max 8 characters)
<strong>Config.SellVehiclePrompt = "[E] Sell Vehicle"
</strong>Config.SellVehicleKeyBind = 38
Config.EnableSellVehicle = true -- Vehicles are sold back to the dealerships - they must pay for the vehicle but receive the vehicle as stock
Config.SellVehiclePercent = 0.6 -- 60% of current sale price
</code></pre>

#### New Config Options within Dealership:

```lua
    sellVehicle = vector3(-27.89, -1082.1, 26.64), -- sell vehicle location
    enableFinance = true,
    hideMarkers = false,
    markers = { id = 21, size = { x = 0.3, y = 0.3, z = 0.3 }, color = { r = 255, g = 255, b = 255, a = 120 }, bobUpAndDown = 0, faceCamera = 0, rotate = 1, drawOnEnts = 0 },
    showroomJobWhitelist = {}, -- format: showroomJobWhitelist = { mechanic = {1, 2, 3} }
    showroomGangWhitelist = {}, -- (QB only) format: showroomGangWhitelist = { lostmc = {1, 2, 3} }
    disableShowroomPurchase = false, -- if you want to use /directsale only
    directSaleDistance = 50, -- how far away employees can use /directsale
    job = "cardealer", -- Owned dealerships only; job employees get within QB/ESX
```

## Employees

You can now hire employees via the Dealership Management > Employees tab.

Employees can be one of three ranks: Manager, Supervisor or Sales. You cannot change this, but you can configure how this aligns to ranks for the job in your framework via `framework/sv-functions.lua`

Here is the permissions breakdown:
