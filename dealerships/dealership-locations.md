# Dealership Locations

Some important notes about dealership locations:

* A dealership can be `self-service` or `owned`
* If a dealership is self service, there are no stock levels and vehicles are entirely managed via /dealeradmin.
* If a dealership is owned, you can set the owner in /dealeradmin, which will then give the owner access to the Open Management location, configurable in the config.
* Dealership categories dictate what categories are browsable and what vehicles will be available in the showroom UI.
