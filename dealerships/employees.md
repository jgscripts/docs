# Employees

You can hire employees in an **owned dealership** via the Dealership Management > Employees tab.

Employees can be one of three ranks: Manager, Supervisor or Sales. You cannot change this, but you can configure how this aligns to ranks for the job in your framework via `framework/sv-functions.lua`

Here is the permissions breakdown:
