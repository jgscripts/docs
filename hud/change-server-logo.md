# Change Server Logo

JG HUD supports displaying your server's logo, if you choose to enable it. By default, we've added an example logo in the root of the `jg-hud` folder named `server-logo.png`. Replacing this to use your own is as simple as replacing this file.

Please note that the image must be named exactly as `server-logo` and it must be in the `.png` image format.

The optimal image size is 200x120px. We recommend adjusting your logo and using an image of this size, although any size of image will be adjusted automatically.
