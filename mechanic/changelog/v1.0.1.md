# v1.0.1

{% hint style="danger" %}
Due to the number of files changed, the developer highly recommends that you perform a full reinstall of the script to ensure everything works smoothly!
{% endhint %}

## Fixes

* Added all missing locales (mostly management & employees)
* %n error with locales text replacement
* Turbo not sticking in tablet
* Money from tuning orders not going into society fund
* UI crash when using dyno share sheet, sending an invoice or using lighting controller
* "Stop vehicle first" should happen less often or when the vehicle isn't actually moving
* Prevent passenger from using tuning menu
* Invisibility exploit for passengers when using tuning menu
* `vehShared` error on Qbox
* The massive number of errors when opening tuning app (you were missing the `tuning = {}` in your config, but it will no longer crash if this is missing)
* Disabling tuning options now _actually_ disables them
* Vehicle lifts being in the wrong direction (hopefully fixed now)
