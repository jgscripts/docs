# v1.0.11

{% hint style="danger" %}
Due to the number of files changed, the developer highly recommends that you perform a full reinstall of the script to ensure everything works smoothly!
{% endhint %}

## Please Read Before Updating!

1. There is a new database table you need to add:

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `mechanic_vehicledata` (  
  `plate` varchar(10) NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
  `data` text NOT NULL
);
```

2. You are no longer _required_ to use the jg-mechanic get/setVehicleProperties exports. You can use your own. I guess ours is recommended, but I would also recommend ox\_lib's.
3. If another script changes your vehicle's plate, you _NEED_ to run this export (server-side) or you will lose your vehicle's data:

```lua
exports["jg-mechanic"]:vehiclePlateUpdated(currentPlate, newPlate)
```

## Fixes

* Rewritten the storage of custom vehicle properties to a new data layer separate from the vehicle props JSON.
* Fix scenario where vehicle tuning, servicing, stancing would disappear in de-sync scenarios.
* Fix free upgrades exploit (due to previous preview data cache not being cleared)
* Unencrypted vehicle repair code
* Fix where wheels would be installed immediately when placing an order for them
* Switch xenons to colour IDs so they sync
* Add vehicle blacklist for servicing
* Add vehicle & engine type blacklist for config.tuning parts
* Add audio streaming timeout
* Fix repeatable refunds exploit (when deleting orders)
