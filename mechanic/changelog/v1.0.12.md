# v1.0.12



{% hint style="info" %}
Had no idea and no reproduction of this bug for weeks, but I found it this afternoon. I'm so sorry for everyone who has been suffering this bug. I was accidently overwriting my storage of vehicles' "base handling", meaning that servicing damage would be applied exponentially if you get in and out of your vehicle multiple times. Without this data, performance wouldn't reset when servicing a vehicle part & vehicles wouldn't go back to stock when removing performance parts.
{% endhint %}

## Fixes

* Stop `baseHandling` statebag being reset when getting in/out of a vehicle multiple times

## Changed files

* `server/sv-vehicleprops.lua`
