# v1.0.2

{% hint style="danger" %}
Due to the number of files changed, the developer highly recommends that you perform a full reinstall of the script to ensure everything works smoothly!
{% endhint %}

## Fixes

* Fix issue where preview (ghost) vehicle would duplicate - huge thanks to @Osas
* Fix xenonHeadlights price `NaN` bug
* Fix QBCore `SetJobDuty`
* Fix `vehShared can't index a nil value` error
* Fix qb-skillbar firing callback immediately
* Electric vehicles now actually have electric vehicle servicing parts

## Sound

_xSound has been completely removed as a dependency_, and the script now uses the native sound engine. If you installed xsound for this script, you can remove it.

## Locales

I found even more missing locales... sorry! Again, you will need to do a diff check if you have modified locales. There weren't too many added!

{% hint style="info" %}
**Config**

&#x20;No config changes!
