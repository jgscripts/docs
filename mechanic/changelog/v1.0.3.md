# v1.0.3

{% hint style="danger" %}
Due to the number of files changed, the developer highly recommends that you perform a full reinstall of the script to ensure everything works smoothly!
{% endhint %}

## Improvements

* Native Qbox support (will also be autodetected with `Framework = "auto"`)
* Motorbikes can be serviced (with special UI), dyno'ed, tuned & have NOS installed if desired
* Disable ability for mechanic employees to self-service vehicles
* jg-vehiclemileage also has `Framework = "auto"` by default

## Fixes

* Fix bug where orders applied via the tablet would not stick (issue with `applyVehicleProps` statebag)
* Fix issue where livery could not be removed (vastly improved get/setVehicleProperties functions)
* Fix issue where all vehicles would gain a speed + traction boost when servicing is enabled
* Fix issue where vehicles _without_ an engine bone could not be worked on

## Locales

Added 2 more missing locales: `orderHasBeenPlaced` & `contactMechanicToFulfill`. Thanks for all the locale submissions so far, these will be added to the project by default at some point soon. If you're translated the script, it would be awesome if you were willing to share it with the community!
