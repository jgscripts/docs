## Handling

Handling code has been completely reworked! Special thanks to @You Like Dabs for helping me get to the bottom of some of the more complex issues. Furthermore, any code that touches vehicle handling at all has been moved into a new, unencrypted file called `cl-handling.lua`. This should give you maximum flexibility in the case you have a complex vehicle setup and need to ensure there are no conflicts with our systems.

## Fixes

* Fix issue where tablet based tuning wouldn't save when the customer inserted the vehicle into a garage (statebag not replicated)
* Fix issue where only 1 inventory item would be taken when applying orders requiring multiple parts

## Other

* Added ped holding tablet animation when using the tablet
* Some tweaks to the carlift model + code to improve reliability and prevent prop falling through the map
