# v1.2.0



{% hint style="info" %}
If you haven't modified `config.mods.lua`, 100% replace it, if you have modified it do a quick diff check and implement the new changes
{% endhint %}

## **Improvements**

* Ability to name performance options (such as Race Brakes or Engine Level 1) in the config.mods.lua - see new `overrideOptions` in the default config (I recommend just using the new config file!)

## **Fixes**

* Fix infrequent bug where the server could take a different amount to the visual cart due to a bug in the server calculation
* Fix bulletproof tyres not sticking
* Fix exploit where item could be removed during repair
* Fix issue where removing pearlescence would add multiple items to basket
* Fix issue where tuning menus opened with event would fail at checkout
* Fix potential future issue where plates returned as `false` or `""` could be persisted to mechanic\_vehicledata
* Hide non-working HSW performance options from console GTA 5 via the new `overrideOptions` feature
* Fix issue where fuel would leak when using third-party garage scripts for storage
* Maybe fix UI going clear, but probably not I got inconsistent results
* Fix bug where `COUNT()` SQL query would fail on some installations
* Fix issue where a non-styled "0" would appear in tuning UI if the price is $0
* Support quadbikes wherever cars are supported (mainly tablet functions)

## **The Future**&#x20;

I _am_ looking to add more functionality to Mechanic in future updates and I've seen the requests - but getting this gigantic script completely stable has been a heck of a job in itself. Plus, I am working on some new scripts in the background\
I appreciate your patience!&#x20;
