# Tuning

JG Mechanic includes powerful custom tuning functionality, such as engine swaps, custom drivetrains, traction options and more. These options allow you to take roleplay to a whole new level, creating options not previously available as part of the base GTA game.

These options directly modify the vehicle's [_handling file_](https://gtamods.com/wiki/Handling.meta); which can be complex. We provide a suite of default custom tuning options that will be appealing to most players, but you may want to create your own. If you don't have any understanding of how handling files work, you will likely run into problems.

All customisation is done in `config/config.tuning.lua`. This docs page is designed to be an FAQ for this file, so you can get to creating your own custom tuning options as soon as possible.

## I did an engine swap, why is my vehicle slower?

The script is not broken, this functionality modifies the vehicle's handling file, and some vehicles can have wildly different handling files. The default configured handling changes, therefore, don't work well on all vehicles. They have been specifically tuned for the vanilla GTA vehicles.

This typically happens with addon vehicles, when their handling file is unbalanced. By default, our engine swaps **overwrite** certain handling values (see below). If some of the values modified as part of the swap were set too high in the vehicle's base handling file to compensate for other values that were set improperly, this can actually make your vehicle slower.

In these cases, unfortunately it is up to you to modify `config.tuning.lua` to make the handling changes more appropriate for the vehicles in your server. Or, what we would recommend more, is to improve the handling files of the addon vehicles in your server.&#x20;

## What do the different config options mean?
