# Installation

{% hint style="danger" %}
Do **NOT** change the name of the resource. Changing the folder name or any other names in any way will break the script.
{% endhint %}

1. Extract the zip and move the `jg-scoreboard` resource inside of the `resources/[qb]` or `resources/[esx_addons]` folder in your server.
2. Configure the `config.lua` file as necessary for your needs!
3. If you still have `qb-scoreboard` installed, you may want to disable it as it uses the same `HOME` keybind. Or you can change the keybind in the config!
