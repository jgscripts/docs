# Introduction

JG Vehicle Mileage is a completely free script, for tracking your vehicle's mileage in real-time and showing it's current mileage with a clean UI. It's compatible with QBCore, Qbox & ESX (and even [custom frameworks](custom-framework.md) with some small modifications!)

It's also heavily integrated with our other scripts, such as for vehicle wear in [JG Mechanic](https://jgscripts.com/scripts/mechanic), and you can view your vehicle's mileage from within the garage with [JG Advanced Garages](https://jgscripts.com/scripts/advanced-garages).
